    "# Who developed Python Programming Language\n",
    "# Python was created by Guido van Rossum\n",
    "\n",
    "# Which type of Programming does Python support? \n",
    "# Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, meaning it supports multiple programming styles. Specifically, Python supports:\n",
    "#1: Procedural Programming:\n",
    "#2:Functional Programming (FP):\n",
    "#3:Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers\n",
    "# Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers.  This means that variables, functions, classes, etc. \n",
    "# with different capitalization are considered distinct entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is the correct extension of the Python file\n",
    "# The correct extension for Python source code files is \".py\n",
    "\n",
    "# Is Python code compiled or interpreted\n",
    "# Python is both compiled and interpreted\n",
    "# Compilation:\n",
    "# When you run a Python program, the source code (.py file) is first compiled into a lower-level representation called bytecode \n",
    "# (.pyc or .pyo files).\n",
    "# Interpretation:\n",
    "# The Python interpreter then executes the bytecode line by line, translating each instruction into machine code that can be directly\n",
    "#  executed by the computer's processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "  print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  print(\"x is not greater than 5\")\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "  print(i)\n",

    "# State a character used to give single-line comments in Python\n",
    "# In Python, the character used to give single-line comments is the hash symbol (#)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on\n",
    "# The command python --version or python -V can be used to check the installed Python version on the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called\n",
    "# Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a construct called lambda\n",

    "# What does pip stand for python\n",
    "# Pip is a recursive acronym for \"Preferred Installer Program\" or \"Pip Installs Packages\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mention a few built-in functions in python\n",
    "# Python comes with a variety of built-in functions that help you perform common tasks. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "# len(object): Returns the length (number of items) of an object like a string, list, tuple, or dictionary.\n",
    "# print(object): Outputs the specified object to the console.\n",
    "# type(object): Returns the type of the specified object.\n",
    "# int(x): Converts x to an integer.\n",
    "# float(x): Converts x to a floating-point number.\n",
    "# str(x): Converts x to a string.\n",
    "# range(start, stop, step): Generates a sequence of numbers from start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive) with an optional step.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python\n",
    "# An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "# What are the benefits of using Python\n",
    "# Ease of Use and Readability ,Simple Syntax,Clean Code,Versatility and Flexibility etc\n",
    "\n",
    "# How is memory managed in Python\n",
    "# Python employs a multifaceted approach to memory management, primarily handled automatically by the Python interpreter, \n",
    "# relieving the developer of manual memory allocation and deallocation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Download Python Installer:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Visit the official Python website: python.org.\n",
    "# Navigate to the Downloads section and download the latest version of Python for Windows. Choose either the 64-bit or 32-bit installer based on your system architecture.\n",
    "# Run the Installer:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Once downloaded, run the installer executable (.exe file).\n",
    "# Make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python x.x to PATH\" during the installation process. This will automatically set the necessary path variables.\n",
    "# Verify Installation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a command prompt (CMD) and type python --version. This should display the installed Python version if the installation was successful.\n",
    "# Setting Path Variables Manually (if not done during installation):\n",
    "# If you didn't select the option to add Python to PATH during installation or if you need to do it manually:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find Python Installation Path:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Locate the folder where Python is installed. By default, it's usually C:\\PythonXX (where XX is the version number).\n",

    "# In the Environment Variables window, find the PATH variable in the \"System variables\" section and click on \"Edit...\".\n",
